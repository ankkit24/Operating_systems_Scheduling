Q1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Ans. 
1. EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULER:

Advantages -
* This is one of the schedular which eradictes the problem of starvation which we face in the default (round-robin schedular).
* It is based on the randon number concept and hence, all the processes have equal chances of getting the processor to run.
* Randomization allows us to avoid strange corner case behaviors
* This is a lightweight schedular as it involves only the decision making on the basis of a random number obtained, whose generation is quick.

Disadvantages -
* This depends entirely on the value of lamda or the random number generated.
* If a process goes into a wait state with a lower priority, then it might not get a fair chance to resume.
* The lower priority processes might have to wait longer if the random number generation does not produce frequent low values.


2. LINUX-LIKE SCHEDULER:

Advantages -
* There is no randomization in choosing the process for scheduling apart from removing the starvation problem.
* Higher priority processes are given preferences, specially the ones which did not run completely.
* If an I/O process goes into a wait state, it gets a fair chance to bounce back to execution soon.
* The use of goodness values to compare the high priority and the waiting process makes it fair to choose the right process to execute.

Disadvantages -
* Exponential is a lighter schedular as compared to the Linux-like schedular.
* This algorithm takes more clock ticks for decision making and execution.
* In case there are lots of processes, then the calculations involved may take a much higher time in decision making.

3. ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULER OF XINU:

Advantages -
* Its much more light-weight than the other two algorithms as there are no calculations involved.
* It just compares the priority of the processes in the queue and makes a decision for execution.
* High priority processes get a fair chance and a good response time.

Disadvantages -
* It faces a starvation problem for lower priority processes.
* Processes with low priority wait for a long as the high/current processes run first.
* There might be a lot of context switching involved which may cost the performance.

Q2. Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Ans.
The NULL process comes into picture when no other processes are there in the ready queue.

ROUND-ROBIN SCHEDULER OF XINU:
* When there are no processes in the queue, it schedules NULL process.

EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION SCHEDULER: 
* When the random number generated is more than the NPROC value.

LINUX-LIKE SCHEDULER:
* When the goodness values for the processes are zero and there are no processes in the queue, the NULL process is scheduled.
